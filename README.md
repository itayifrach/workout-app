## Description:


 **What my app currently does:**
        At the moment,my app is able to save and show your previos exercises. It can also calculate your BMI,and to show a list of workouts with explAnation which you can choose from.


  **Technologies and why i used them:**
 
 *Firebase:*
 The reason why i used firebase(store and auth):
because i can add more workouts to choose from directly firestore,instead of in the code so the app is updating automatically.


**challenges:**
Some of the challenges i faced were:
- deciding wether or not using a single activity based app ,or activities.I decided to mix both option.
